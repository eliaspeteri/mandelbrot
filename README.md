# mandelbrot
A mandelbrot set generated with p5.js.
To run, Node.js is required. After, run npx live-server in the root folder and navigate to localhost (it should open up automatically). Default amount of iterations is 100 but can be adjusted in the sketch.js-file through the maxiterations variable.
